    <p>Olivier Copiel  is a comic book artist that I admire.
         I really like the way he combines realism with traditional 
         comic book art visuals.</p>

        <p>Jadakiss is a New York based rapper I admire. 
            I like his consistency as a rapper 
            and his story telling ability. </p>

          <p>Khary Randolph is a comic book artist that is a source inspiration for me. I really enjoy the way he uses angles in his 
            character designs it gives a sense of movement that fit well 
            in comic books.</p>
